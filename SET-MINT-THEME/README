### SET-MINT-THEME MODULE ###

This module preserves your theme settings and custom cursors across reboots.

WHY NEEDED:
arcOS runs on a volatile /cow filesystem that resets on reboot.
Theme settings in ~/.config/dconf/user are lost on reboot.
Custom cursors in ~/.icons/ are lost on reboot.

WHAT IT DOES:
On each boot, this module:
1. Installs the save-theme utility to /opt/arcOS/bin/
2. Installs custom cursor theme (Bibata-Modern-Amber) system-wide
3. Sets cursor theme via update-alternatives and ~/.icons/default/
4. Restores saved theme settings from dconf files (if they exist)

HOW TO USE:
1. Boot into arcOS - default system theme will load
2. Use Cinnamon Settings to choose your preferred theme
3. Run "save-theme" from terminal or application menu
4. Your theme preferences are saved to /arcHIVE/QRV/$MYCALL/SAVED/SET-MINT-THEME/
5. On next boot, your saved theme will be automatically restored

SAVE THEME UTILITY:
The save-theme utility captures your current theme settings:
- GTK theme (Applications)
- Icon theme
- Desktop theme (Cinnamon)
- Cursor theme

Settings are saved as dconf dumps to persistent storage.

CUSTOM CURSORS:
Current cursor theme: Bibata-Modern-Amber
To change cursor theme:
1. Copy new cursor directory to this module directory
2. Edit SET-MINT-THEME.sh to reference your cursor directory
3. Use Cinnamon Settings to select the cursor theme
4. Run save-theme to persist your choice

SAVED SETTINGS LOCATION:
/arcHIVE/QRV/$MYCALL/SAVED/SET-MINT-THEME/
- desktop-interface.dconf (Cinnamon desktop settings)
- cinnamon-theme.dconf (Cinnamon theme name)
- gnome-interface.dconf (GTK application settings)

DISABLE MODULE:
Comment out "SET-MINT-THEME.sh" in ENABLED_MODULES file
