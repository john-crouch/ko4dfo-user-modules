### INSTRUCTIONS ###

1) Ensure the ko4dfo-user-modules repository is cloned into the USER Module directory.

2) Add OBSIDIAN.sh to the ENABLED_MODULES file:
   echo "OBSIDIAN.sh" >> ko4dfo-user-modules/ENABLED_MODULES

3) Reboot or re-run Station Setup. With network connectivity, Obsidian will
   download automatically from GitHub releases.

4) Launch Obsidian from the application menu and select or create your vault.
   Recommended vault location: /arcHIVE/QRV/$MYCALL/notes/
   (Vaults are user-managed and NOT handled by this module)

### VERSION PINNING (optional) ###

To pin a specific Obsidian version instead of auto-updating:

   echo "1.5.3" > /arcHIVE/QRV/$MYCALL/SAVED/OBSIDIAN/version.txt

To return to auto-update behavior, delete the version.txt file.

### MANUAL INSTALLATION ###

If first-run fails (no network), you can install manually:

1) Download the .deb from: https://obsidian.md/download
2) Place it in: /arcHIVE/QRV/$MYCALL/SAVED/OBSIDIAN/packages/
3) Create version file: echo "X.X.X" > /arcHIVE/QRV/$MYCALL/SAVED/OBSIDIAN/cached_version.txt
   (Replace X.X.X with the version you downloaded)
4) Reboot or re-run Station Setup

### WHAT PERSISTS ###

- Obsidian settings, themes, and plugins (~/.config/obsidian/)
- Cached .deb installer for offline reboots
- Version preferences

### WHAT DOES NOT PERSIST ###

- Your vaults (notes) - store these on /arcHIVE yourself
- This module only handles the application, not your data

### NOTES ###

- The module will auto-update Obsidian when a new version is released
  (unless you have pinned a version)
- In multi-user installations, Obsidian config will remain configured for
  a previous user if the next user does not also use this module.
