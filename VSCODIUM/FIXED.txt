VSCODIUM MODULE - FIXED AND WORKING

The module now:
1. Properly manages the symlink without creating nested directories
2. Uses rsync instead of mv to prevent directory nesting issues
3. Installs extensions from .vsix files
4. Detects already-installed extensions to avoid re-installation

TESTED AND VERIFIED:
- VSCodium launches successfully ✓
- Extension installed: github.vscode-github-actions v0.28.2 ✓
- No nested directory structure ✓
- Symlink working correctly ✓

USAGE:
1. Place .vsix files in config/ directory
2. Run module (or reboot)
3. Extensions automatically installed

IMPORTANT:
- The --install-extension command is broken in this VSCodium version
- Module works around this by manually extracting .vsix files
- Download extensions from https://open-vsx.org/
