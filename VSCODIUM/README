### INSTRUCTIONS ###

1) Move the VSCODIUM directory into the USER Module directory.

2) Move the included 95_VSCODIUM.sh script into the USER Module directory.
	- Up one level from the VSCODIUM directory

3) To preserve and auto-install your extensions:

   Use .vsix extension files:
   - Download .vsix extension files from https://open-vsx.org/
   - Place them in the config/ directory
   - They will be automatically installed on module run

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- This version of VSCodium has a broken --install-extension command
- The module works around this by manually extracting .vsix files
- Use open-vsx.org to download extension .vsix files
- Extension IDs in extensions.txt are NOT supported due to the codium bug

Module Features:
- Preserves VSCodium settings, themes, keybindings, and workspace data
- Automatically installs extensions from .vsix files
- User data stored in: /arcHIVE/QRV/<CALLSIGN>/SAVED/VSCODIUM/
- Extensions stored in: /arcHIVE/QRV/<CALLSIGN>/SAVED/VSCODIUM/extensions/

To deactivate:
- Place the 95_VSCODIUM.sh script back inside the VSCODIUM directory and reboot
