### INSTRUCTIONS ###

1) Ensure the ko4dfo-user-modules repository is cloned into the USER Module directory.

2) Disable the CORE VARA module by moving its script:
   mv /arcHIVE/QRV/$MYCALL/arcos-linux-modules/CORE/30_VARA.sh \
      /arcHIVE/QRV/$MYCALL/arcos-linux-modules/CORE/VARA/

3) Add 20_VARA.sh to the ENABLED_MODULES file:
   echo "20_VARA.sh" >> ko4dfo-user-modules/ENABLED_MODULES

4) Reboot or re-run Station Setup.

Notes:
- First boot will take several minutes to install VARA (silent install).
- Subsequent boots restore from saved tarball (fast).
- This module uses Wine Mono instead of native .NET Framework.
- Required for VarAC module to function properly.
- VARA HF and VARA FM will appear in the Wine category of the Main Menu.
- In multi-user installations, VARA will remain configured for a previous
  user if the next user does not also use this module.
